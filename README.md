# Scripts for spectra of topological slab, wire and particle [ARCHIVED]
Coarse-grained tight-binding model of Bi2Se3 topological insulator slab, wire and particle.

- The slab.m file can be used to see the Dirac cone on the surface of a planar slab.

- The wire.m file can be used to reproduce the bandstructure of a topological nanowire from

- The particle.m file can be used to reproduce discrete spectrum of topological nanoparticles in

## Getting Started
Each .m file is self-contained. Just open and run modifying the input parameters at top of the file as needed.
